LAB_1

Objective: 
This lab exercise will help you practice essential MATLAB concepts, including creating and manipulating numeric arrays, 
performing matrix concatenation, and using the repmat function.
%================================================================
•	Part 1: Matrix Sum
1.	Create a 3x3 matrix named matrixA with the following values:
                  1 2 3
                  4 5 6
                  7 8 9
2.	Create a 3x3 matrix named matrixB with the following values:
                  10 11 12
                  13 14 15
                  16 17 18
3.	Calculate the sum of "matrixA" and "matrixB" and store it in a variable called matrixSum.
4.	Display the contents of "matrixSum".

%================================================================
•	Part 2: Matrix Concatenation

1.	Create a row vector named "rowVector" with values from 1 to 5.
2.	Create a column vector named "columnVector" with values from 6 to 10.
3.	Concatenate rowVector and columnVector horizontally.
4.	store the result in a variable called "horizontalConcat".
5.	Display the contents of horizontalConcat.
%================================================================
•	Part 3: Using repmat Function

1.	Create a 2x2 matrix named "originalMatrix" with any values you like.
2.	Use the repmat function to replicate originalMatrix into a 4x4 pattern and
3.	 store it in a variable called "repeatedMatrix".
4.	Display the contents of repeatedMatrix
.

%================================================================
•	Part 4: Challenge := identity matrix

1.	Create a 3x3 identity matrix (a matrix with diagonal elements as 1 and others as 0) and store it in a variable called identityMatrix.
2.	Perform matrix multiplication between identityMatrix and matrixA. 
3.	Store the result in a variable called matrixProduct.
4.	Display the contents of matrixProduct.
